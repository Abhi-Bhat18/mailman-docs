## Docker deployment

Deploying Mailman with Docker is straightforward, allowing you to get the application up and running quickly without manual dependency installation.

<Steps>

1. Copy the `docker-compose.yaml` file 

   ```yaml
   version: '3.8'

    services:
    mailman-ui:
        image: abhishekbhat18/mailman-ui:latest
        ports:
        - '3000:3000'
        environment:
        NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL: http://api-server:1335
        networks:
        - mailman-network

    mailman-api:
        image: abhishekbhat18/mailman-api:latest
        container_name: mailman-api
        ports:
        - '1335:1335'
        env_file:
        - ./.env
        restart: unless-stopped
        networks:
        - mailman-network

    networks:
    mailman-network:
        driver: bridge
    ```
    :::note 
    For env variables take a look at [configuration]() section
2. Run docker with the following command
    ```sh
    docker compose up -d
    ```

</Steps>
